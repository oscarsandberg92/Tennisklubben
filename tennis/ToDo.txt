Todo-List:
[X] Implement validation on the login form and registration form
    Needs more work:
[X] Save the information collected from the registration form
[X] After a successfull login, the username should be printed somewhere in the menu. (Maybe replacing login button?)
[X] If user is logged in, present an option to log out
[X] Create a "User" class to make it possible to save multiple users
[X] Use the user class to check if the login information is correct. Otherwise display a message that says "Username 
    and password does not match".
[X] Create a Booking class to store all the bookings.
[X] Inform the user that he/she needs to login before bookings
[X] Menuchoice to display the users bookings.
[X] Add an alert when a booking is made

VALIDATION TODOS:
[X] Check if email already exists
[X] Set appropriate min/max on court selection.
[X] Make it impossible to have a username with less than 4 characters.
[X] Make it impossible to have numbers and symbols in  first name and last name
[X] Make sure it is a valid email. The built in control accepts for example oscar@com, wich is not a valid email
[X] Check if date has not passed
[ ] Check if time has not passed




[ ] Add a function to cancel a booking (?) maybe 
[X] Fill the "content" divs with content
[X] Refactor and clean up the code
